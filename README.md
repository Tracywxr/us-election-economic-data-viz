# Voting Preferences and Economic Attitudes Analysis

This project explores how voters' economic attitudes influence their party preferences in U.S. presidential elections from 2004 to 2020. Through multiple interactive visualizations, the analysis examines how income groups, perceptions of unemployment, and economic attitudes relate to party choices.

## Features

- **Income Groups and Party Preferences**: Visualizes how different income groups supported the two major political parties (Democrats and Republicans) over time, with the ability to filter by state.
- **Unemployment Perception and Party Preferences**: Displays how voters' perceptions of past and future unemployment influenced their party preferences using a bubble matrix.
- **Economic Attitudes and Party Divides**: Shows how Democratic and Republican voters' attitudes towards different economic groups evolved over time.
