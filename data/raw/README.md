# Raw Data Folder

- Mar. 5th, spoke with Dr. Moosvi after class and were told we could put in a subset of the original datafile here due to the size of the American National Election Survey (ANES).

- The original ANES cumulative datafile can be found here: https://electionstudies.org/data-center/anes-time-series-cumulative-data-file/
- please create a free account to access the data. They wish to verify people do not use this data for commercial purposes or to try to identify participants. 

- `raw` - raw data should go in this directory; you should add the original source file here. Always keep the original data file without editing.
